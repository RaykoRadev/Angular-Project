## üõ†Ô∏è Fixes & Improvements

- [x] Fix **email validation** for Login and Register forms:

  - Connect Angular's `Validators.email` to both form controls.
  - Show `<mat-error>` if email is invalid.

- [x] Fix **layout bug**: password mismatch error is showing _inside input_:

  - Ensure `<mat-error>` is inside `<mat-form-field>` and outside `<input>`.
  - Replace `@if` with `*ngIf` to ensure proper rendering.

- [x] Update **navigation buttons** on login/register/logout:
  - Use `BehaviorSubject` in an `AuthService`.
  - Subscribe in navigation component.
  - Conditionally show `.guest` and `.user` links.
